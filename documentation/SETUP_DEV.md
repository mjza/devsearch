### âœ… 1. Install Composer (if not yet installed)

1. Download the Windows installer:  
   ðŸ‘‰ [https://getcomposer.org/Composer-Setup.exe](https://getcomposer.org/Composer-Setup.exe)

2. **During installation**, make sure to select the correct PHP path from your XAMPP installation:  
   For XAMPP:  
   ```
   C:\xampp\php\php.exe
   ```

3. After installation, confirm it works:  
   Open **Command Prompt** and run:

   ```bash
   composer --version
   ```

   You should see the Composer version printed.

### âœ… 5. Generate Laravel App Key

You can also call it directly:

```bash
"C:\xampp\php\php.exe" artisan key:generate
```

### âœ… 6. Configure Database in `.env`

If using MySQL from XAMPP, set this in your `.env` file:

```
DB_CONNECTION=mysql
DB_HOST=127.0.0.1
DB_PORT=3306
DB_DATABASE=devsearch_db
DB_USERNAME=root
DB_PASSWORD=
```

> Create the `devsearch_db` database via **phpMyAdmin** or **MySQL CLI**.
